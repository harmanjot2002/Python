#Once Anaconda is installed,Pandas will be installed with it.
#Anaconda is a open-source python distribution for scipy.

#Higher dimensional data structure is a container of lower dimensional data structure.
#Data-Frame is a container of series and panel is a container of data frame.It is a heterogenous collection of data elements and size of table can be changed.It is a 2D labelled size-mutable tabular data structure.
#Series-It is a one-dimensional collection of similar elements.Series is nothing,but a collection of integers.
    #1.Collection of cimilar elements.
    #2.Size cannot be changed(immutable)
    #3.Values of data can be changed(mutable)
